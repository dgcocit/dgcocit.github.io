      <description>There are times when going to worship services is nice and comfortable, attendance is good, the people are friendly and things seem unlikely to change. Complacency can set in and take root in situations like this making efforts to contact outsiders evaporate into no effort at all. When the attendance numbers are good and thinking that they always will be is a dangerous train of thought. Experience shows that membership is a pendulum that swings high to a comfortable number but inevitably it swings back to a low where nervous despair can set in and work for the Lord gets put aside.</description>
