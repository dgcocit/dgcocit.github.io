      <description>Religious people like to present themselves in a way they hope to be seen. Most often it is in a way that they see themselves. They stand before us showing a resolute dedicated individual, unwavering in support of the Gospel. While to others their stand for gospel teaching is not so firm and sometimes seems to be against what the Bible even stands for.
For sure each Lordâ€™s Day the image of correctness is seen by all when the congregation is assembled, provided for all to see.</description>
