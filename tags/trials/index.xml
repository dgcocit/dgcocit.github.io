      <description>There is a mean and anti-Christian temperament that exists and those who would feel proud to stand against moral values and righteousness are vocal and visible. Professing to be godless is not a characteristic looked down upon but rather it seems it is boasted about. The lingering bitterness against the followers of Christ, is prevalent in all areas of society.
This is typical of the enemies of God that we read about in the Bible even though it seems like modern-day attitudes.</description>
