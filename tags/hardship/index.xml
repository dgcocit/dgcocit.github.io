      <description>Not feeling well can be difficult to deal with no matter how old you are. And although feeling ill our daily decisions continue regardless of our health condition. Everyday time tables tick-tock on while one deals with alternating feeling better soon and being so sick you think no one will notice if schedules are missed.
However, sickness doesnâ€™t care about your schedules and it seems to know when to flare up and make you feel a little worse whenever you even think about your responsibilities.</description>
