      <description>There is a time to remember, reflect and recognize where you’ve been and where you are headed. Married people do this all the time on their anniversary. This is not like a birthday where it’s a celebration of another year passing by – another year older and deeper in debt. There is not much reflection on birthdays until maybe later on in life.
Remembering your wedding day however, is remembering the day God joined you together.</description>

      <title>Memorial Day</title>

      <description>Remembering things is often difficult. Our memory system is weak. Even though some may claim that they may have a photographic memory time is not their friend. Trying to remember specifics can be challenging. Names and dates sometimes need repetition to recall them properly. God has recognized man&amp;rsquo;s need for such reminders.
Deeds and actions done years ago fade from memory quickly because they are so seldom brought to mind. Acts of bravery, kindness and generosity are fresh but for a short while.</description>
